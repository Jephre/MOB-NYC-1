    // THIS is actually the DELEGATE for our app. E.g. if you want to do something when the app is in the background.  Delegate = trusted friend, it provides information, and gets notified about changes. There is only ever one delegate. Think of protocols as the badges to a boy scout (delegate). Notification differs from this as it's a one-way street (broadcast). Other parts of app can subscribe to these notifications. 
    // When your view controller goes out of view, may want to unsubscribe any observers from notifications.
